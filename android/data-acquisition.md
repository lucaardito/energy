## Firedcircuitus
It is an Arduino board. The sample rate is 10Hz, too low for an accurate sampling.

The setup for the acquisition has: 0A to 2.5A range for the current, 100 samples to read at 1KHz frequency and a 50mOhm shunt resistor. The resistor is placed in series to the mobile phone and it is used to calculate the current that flows into the device. It has a crucial relevance for the precision of the acquisition.

LabView 2011 is the software trough whitch data is acquired.

### Shunt Resistor

Due to the circuit configuration, the chose of the resistor has a great impact on the test and the data. It is placed in series to the device, hence there is a voltage dependent from the flowing current (that is the current absorbed by the phone). This voltage is:
>(1) Vr = R * I
Where Vr is the voltage on the resistor, R is the resistor and I the current.

>(2) V = Vg - Vr
Where V is the voltage on the phone, Vg is the generator and Vr is the voltage on the resistor.

In order to have the smallest possible variation on V, it is necessary to minimize the voltage Vr. This is achieved by reducing the value of R from the formula (1). Of course, in a ideal situation R should be 0Ohm.

Data acquired with the Arduino board shows peaks of current of about 1.2A, then this vaue is considered like a upper bound for the dimensioning of the resistor. To have an idea, three different value of voltage drop (Vr) have been considered: x, x and x:
>(3) R = Vr / I = xV / 1.2A = xOhm
>(4) R = Vr / I = xV / 1.2A = xOhm
>(5) R = Vr / I = xV / 1.2A = xOhm
These values of Vr give, respectively, the following errors on the 5V generated by Vg: x%, x% and x%.

(All or part of them) are acceptable, but the (5) require a resistor that is too small (difficult to find?) and that can lead to considerations over the resistance of the cables. A good compromise, then, is represented by (4). The real resistor used is >insert spec here<
